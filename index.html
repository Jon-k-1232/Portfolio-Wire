                <p id="aboutMeSum">
                    I am a full stack developer, a veteran of the Marine Corps, and graduate of Arizona State University.
                    I am a individual who has a deep passion in full stack development, mobile development,
                    cloud computing, and learning the ever changing environment of AI/ machine learning.
                    I believe the best environments are ones that team work, new discoveries, and humor are celebrated.
                    Feel free to contact me as well as check out a few of the projects I have recently worked on.

                <h3>Project one window goes here.</h3>
                <p>This is an app was created to quiz your knowledge of American history. History questions
                    revolve around the creation of the country and founding fathers. This quiz has little known
                    pieces of history which makes it all more the fun. The theme is red white and blue, that
                    incorporates southern sayings, some humor and patriotism.
